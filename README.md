## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student working at School of Engineering, University of Minho and Leiden University Medical Centre. 

Passionate about science, I hope to take part in a changing world, innovate and contribute to the development of areas such as health, sustainability, and the biotechnology industry.

I work at the intersection of computer science and biology and I'm especially interested in bringing meaning to biological data by using 
state-of-the-art data analysis and artificial intelligence techniques.
